# Launch Report

## Added

- Minimal Next.js frontend with Dockerfile.
- Django `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt`.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use gunicorn.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `RUN_GUIDE.md`, `ERRORS.md`.
- ESLint configuration and updated pre-commit.

## Testing

- `pre-commit` run on all files.
- `pytest` executed locally.

All tasks from `tasks/` are marked as completed, but the frontend and Dockerfiles were missing. They are restored here.
